## Snipe-Agent - A Windows agent for Snipe-IT

## Installation
1. Download and install the latest .msi installer from the [releases tab](https://github.com/ReticentRobot/Snipe-Agent/releases).
2. By default, the program will be installed in Program Files (x86)/Scope-IT/Snipe-Agent. Edit the Snipe-Agent.exe.config file to include your API key and BaseURI from the default values to the ones given by your Snipe-IT instance.
3. Set the Company and Location parameters in Snipe-Agent.exe.config, then run the .exe.

## Features
* The agent creates an asset and fills out the fields:
  - Asset name (currently machine hostname, unless agent is run in interactive mode)
  - Asset id (Asset tag prefix + serial number)
  - Location (from a config file or the Organizational Unit)
  - Warranty (from config file)
  - Status label (from config file)
  - Mac address
  - Make, model of the machine (as reported to Windows)
* Ensures that the assets created is unique
* New locations, makes, models are created as needed


## Getting started
You will need a working [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/) database with API access and an API key. 
*We recommend creating a separate user for the agent with minimal (read + add) permissions.*

You can run it via a GPO or Scheduled task (recommended way is to run the agent once on boot with a delay of 1+ minute)

## Developer Guide

If you want to not only use Snipe-Agent.exe, but edit the sources and build the project, here are some steps for getting started. Snipe-Agent has a dependency on our specific fork of SnipeSharp, so you will need to build it as well.

1. Create a development folder. Inside this folder, clone the following repos:
    * git clone https://github.com/ReticentRobot/SnipeSharp
    * git clone https://github.com/ReticentRobot/Snipe-Agent
2. Open the SnipeSharp project .sln, and build the solution.
3. Open the Snipe-Agent project. Check the 'references' under the Snipe-Agent project, and see if SnipeSharp has been added automatically. Make sure that the path of the SnipeSharp reference points to the repository you just built. If a reference does not exist, you may need to add it manually.
4. Build the SnipeSharp project. It should build correctly - if there are any errors at this stage please file a bug report.
5. You can now proceed to edit the config file so that your API key and BaseURI correspond to your Snipe-IT instance. Once the config file is set, the program can be run.
